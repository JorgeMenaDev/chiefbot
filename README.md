# Chiefbot

Personal chief-of-staff bots, each with its own computer, powered by the GitHub Copilot SDK on your own Copilot plan.

Status: proof of concept. It runs locally, with bot computers as Docker containers under Colima. The GCP deploy (one Compute Engine VM per bot) is written but not deployed: `infra/gcp` and the runbook `docs/deploy-gcp.md`.

See `AGENTS.md` for the architecture.

```bash
bun install
bun run check           # typecheck + tests (no network, no Docker, no GCP)
bun run computer:build  # bundle the worker and build the bot computer image (chiefbot-computer:dev)
bun run dev             # control on http://127.0.0.1:7410 and the desktop app
```

Creating a bot needs Docker (Colima: `colima start`) and the `chiefbot-computer:dev` image. Each bot is a container `chiefbot-<bot id>` with a volume `chiefbot-<bot id>-home` mounted at `/home/bot` (its home and workspace). Its worker dials control's `/worker` WebSocket with a per-bot credential and the bot shows **online**.

`CHIEFBOT_DOCKER_TESTS=1 bun test docker.live` runs the whole loop on real Docker (needs the image). It removes what it creates.

If `bun run dev` fails with `Electron uninstall`, the Electron binary was not downloaded: run `node apps/desktop/node_modules/electron/install.js`.

`bun run dev` starts both apps. To run them apart: `bun run --cwd apps/control dev` and `bun run --cwd apps/desktop dev`.

The desktop dev script unsets `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`. Shells started by T3 Code or other Electron apps set it, and it makes Electron run as plain Node.

## Configuration

| Variable | App | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CHIEFBOT_CONTROL_PORT` | control | `7410` |
| `CHIEFBOT_CONTROL_HOSTNAME` | control | `127.0.0.1` (`0.0.0.0` on the GCP control VM) |
| `CHIEFBOT_DB_PATH` | control | `.data/control.sqlite` (in `apps/control`) |
| `CHIEFBOT_GITHUB_API_URL` | control | `https://api.github.com` |
| `CHIEFBOT_DOCKER_SOCKET` | control | `DOCKER_HOST`'s unix socket, else `~/.colima/default/docker.sock` |
| `CHIEFBOT_COMPUTERS` | control | `docker`; `gce` runs bots as Compute Engine VMs |
| `CHIEFBOT_COMPUTER_IMAGE` | control | `chiefbot-computer:dev` for docker; required for gce |
| `CHIEFBOT_GCP_PROJECT` | control (gce) | required |
| `CHIEFBOT_GCP_ZONE` | control (gce) | `europe-west2-a` (London) |
| `CHIEFBOT_WORKER_CONTROL_URL` | control | `http://host.docker.internal:<port>` (control as a container reaches it) |
| `CHIEFBOT_CONTROL_URL` | desktop | `http://127.0.0.1:7410` |
| `CHIEFBOT_GITHUB_URL` | desktop | `https://github.com` |
| `CHIEFBOT_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | desktop | `Ov23liONZsgOtJmCUaGB` (Chartpilot's public OAuth App: device flow, no secret, 8-hour tokens) |

## Manual check: real GitHub sign-in

Tests use a fake GitHub. This check uses the real one and makes no Copilot chat calls.

1. Run `bun run dev`.
2. In the Chiefbot window, click **Sign in with GitHub**. The window shows a code.
3. Click the link, sign in on github.com/login/device, type the code and approve.
4. Within a few seconds the window shows your login and your Copilot plan (for Copilot Free: `individual (free_limited_copilot)`).
5. Quit and start `bun run dev` again. You are still signed in.
6. Click **Sign out**. The window goes back to **Sign in with GitHub**.

The desktop keeps only control's session token (in the app's user-data folder). GitHub tokens live in `apps/control/.data/control.sqlite`.

## Manual check: a bot gets its own computer

Needs Colima running. Makes no Copilot calls.

1. Run `bun run computer:build`, then `bun run dev`, and sign in.
2. Click **+ New bot**, type a name and press Enter. The bot appears in the sidebar and turns green (**online**) within a few seconds.
3. `docker ps` shows `chiefbot-bot_…` running. `docker logs <name>` says `worker connected to http://host.docker.internal:7410 as bot_…`.
4. Click **Stop**. The bot shows **stopped** and the container has exited. Click **Start**. It comes back **online**.
5. Restart control (save a file in `apps/control`). The bot goes back **online** without a click.
6. Click **Delete**, tick **Also delete its files** and confirm. The bot leaves the sidebar, and `docker ps -a` and `docker volume ls` show nothing for it. Without the tick, the volume `chiefbot-<bot id>-home` stays: remove it with `docker volume rm`.
7. Clean up: `docker rmi chiefbot-computer:dev`.
